# Archivo
Archivo is a cross-platform app for archiving recordings from a TiVo to your computer. It is designed to "just work" and require very little user input or configuration.

## Features
* Automatically find TiVos on your local network
* List the recordings available on each TiVo
* Copy recordings from a TiVo to a computer
* Convert recordings to more convenient video formats
* Remove commercials from recordings
* Delete recordings from the TiVo

## Requirements
* Java 8u40 or higher
* A TiVo Bolt, Roamio, or Premiere
* For best performance, your computer should have at least a dual-core processor and 1 GB of memory
* Plenty of disk space: archiving a one-hour HD recording may temporarily use up to 10 GB of disk space
* Supported operating systems:
  * Mac OS X 10.7.3 and higher
  * Windows Vista and higher
  * Any Linux system with Java 8, FFmpeg 2.8 or higher, HandBrake CLI (command-line interface) 0.10.2 or higher, and Comskip 0.81.89 or higher. The FFmpeg, HandBrake CLI, and Comskip executables must all be in the same directory (e.g., /usr/local/bin) with the names "ffmpeg", "handbrake", and "comskip", and Archivo needs to be run with the `-tooldir` parameter specifying this directory (e.g., `java -jar /path/to/archivo.jar -tooldir /usr/local/bin`).

## Acknowledgments

Development of this project was made substantially easier by the existence of the excellent KMTTG project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/kmttg/). If you want more control over your TiVo than Archivo gives you, KMTTG is probably the tool you're looking for.

Archivo also makes use of the following Free Software projects:
* **FFmpeg** - For repairing video files and trimming commercials (https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
* **Comskip** - For detecting commercials (http://www.kaashoek.com/comskip/)
* **HandBrake** - For converting video files to more convenient formats (https://handbrake.fr/)
* **TivoLibre** - For decoding TiVo recordings into standard MPEG-TS files (https://github.com/fflewddur/tivolibre)
